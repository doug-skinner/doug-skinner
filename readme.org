* Hi there!

- I'm currently a Lead Software Engineer [@CommerceHub](https://www.commercehub.com) focused on building the best teams that I can.
- I'm currently learning how to best learn in public. I think the way I have settled on for now is to maintain multiple public repositories, such that others can find my learnings.
- How to reach me: the best way is to email [me](mailto:dskinne12@gmail.com)
- Pronouns: He/His
